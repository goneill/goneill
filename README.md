- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @goneill
Iâ€™m a lawyer who likes to do little fun programming projects in my spare time. I was a computer science major and worked as a programmer a long time ago. 
I like to solve repetative problems in my profession with programs. I find it both fun and helpful. I'm currently working with Laravel and Livewire. Back when I was a programmer a long time ago I made an MVC framework in ColdFusion, haha. 
Anyway that's me!
